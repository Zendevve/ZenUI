# Development Setup

## 1. Installation
1.  **WoW Client**: Ensure you have a World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (WotLK) client installed.
2.  **Git**: Clone the repository into your `Interface/AddOns/` directory.
    ```bash
    cd "path/to/WoW/Interface/AddOns"
    git clone https://github.com/Zendevve/ZenHUD.git
    ```
3.  **Folder Name**: The folder MUST be named `ZenHUD` for the `.toc` file to load correctly.

## 2. Tools
*   **Editor**: VS Code is recommended.
*   **Extensions**:
    *   `sumneko.lua` (Lua Language Server) - Highly recommended for syntax checking.
    *   `ketho.wow-api` (World of Warcraft API) - For API intellisense.
